**Course:** CPE-2600 Systems Programming  
**Author:** Andrew Bieber  
**Date:** October 27, 2025

## Overview
This lab builds on the **Week 5 Vector Calculator** by introducing dynamic data structures and file persistence.  
Enhancements include:

- **Dynamic memory allocation** for scalable vector storage (via `malloc` and `realloc`)  
- **File I/O support** with `load <file>` and `save <file>` commands using CSV format  
- **Complete memory cleanup** validated using **Valgrind**  
- **Javadoc-style function documentation** for readability and maintainability  

> *AI (ChatGPT) was used exclusively for documentation guidance and Javadoc comment generation.  
> All functional code and logic were implemented independently by Andrew Bieber.*

| `save <file>` | Save all current vectors to a CSV file |
| `list` | Display all stored vectors |
| `clear` | Reset and free all stored vectors |
| `quit` | Exit the program cleanly |
